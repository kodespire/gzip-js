# gzip-js

Gzip, zlib and raw deflate compression for Node.js, Bun, Deno, browsers and edge runtimes, with native bindings to
[madler/zlib](https://github.com/madler/zlib) and a WebAssembly build of the same code for runtimes without native addons.

**Status: planned.** This package will follow the same design as
[zstd-js](https://github.com/kodespire/zstd-js): one C layer shared by a Node-API addon and a
WebAssembly build, prebuilt binaries inside the package (no install scripts), and errors instead
of partial output on truncated or corrupt input. It will handle multi-member gzip files the way `gunzip` does.

Part of the [compression-js](https://github.com/kodespire/compression-js) family. MIT licensed.
